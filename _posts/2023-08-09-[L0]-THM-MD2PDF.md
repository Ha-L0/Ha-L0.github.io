[try hack me - md2pdf](https://tryhackme.com/room/md2pdf)
## Enumeration
### nmap
Initiated a complete scan using Nmap:

```shell
$ nmap -sV -p- mdpdf
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-09 15:00 EDT
Not shown: 65532 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  rtsp
5000/tcp open  rtsp

```

**Results:**

- Port 22: OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5
- Port 80: RTSP (Markdown to PDF converter identified)
- Port 5000: RTSP (Non-functional replica of Port 80's service)

### Web Interface Overview

On port 80, there's an interface that converts markdown to a PDF.

Upon conversion, a resultant PDF is generated.

However, the same interface on port 5000 appears non-functional.

### Directory Enumeration

Using `ffuf` for directory fuzzing on port 5000 and 80 revealed a restricted admin directory:

```shell
$ ffuf -w `fzf-wordlist` -u http://mdpdf.thm:5000/FUZZ

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://mdpdf.thm/FUZZ
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405,500

```

## Vulnerability Analysis
Upon further examination of the HTTP responses post-conversion, it was determined that the web service utilizes `wkhtmlTOpdf 0.12.5`.

A subsequent Google search highlighted a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the closely related version `0.12.6`.

Given the constraints, the only feasible option was to target the `/admin` directory on port 5000 or 80, which eventually revealed the flag.
